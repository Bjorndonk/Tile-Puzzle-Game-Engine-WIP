# Tile-Puzzle-Game-Engine-WIP

This is a small project that I'm working on for fun. It ultimately will be a grid-based logic game similar to minesweeper, wherein the player places tiles from their inventory onto a board to try to solve a logic puzzle. I currently have the following features implimented:
  - Puzzles are stored as .txt files that can be imported by the program and played.
  - Players can move their cursor, pick up and place blocks from their inventory, and return placed blocks to their inventory.
  - Many different types of tiles can be generated from the text file.

I have yet to inplement the logic system that checks if a boardstate is solved, but the surrounding engine is in a functioning state.
